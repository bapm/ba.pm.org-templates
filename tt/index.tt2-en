to learn something more. We are located in/near Bratislava or at least speak

that that the people that are interrested in Perl programming language
get in touch, not just virtualy on the net but also physicaly. The Perl
Mongers meetings has two parts. The first, that last for 1 to 1,5h is to listen
to some presentations from the group members. The second, that is after
